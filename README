# Cards Against Humanity Generator

This Scribus script creates a set of Cards Against Humanity from a CSV file.
[Cards Against humanity] (http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)
[Scribus](http://www.scribus.net)

The attached CSV files contain my norwegian translation of the game.
Thanks to @mrkolby and my family.
Thanks to [Lang](https://github.com/lhoang) for the generator. See the
parent of this fork for his french translation.

## Usage :

* Select the CSV file

The default format is A4 - landscape.
